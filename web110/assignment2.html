      Seasion 2A - Internet Fundamentals/Introduction
      Activity 1: "2.GCFLearnFree tutorials" [Mouse Shortcuts]
      In this activity, I learned "that mouse has many other features and its not only for 'clicking' 'scrolling' like you may know it as". [Something that ive learned was the 'Ctrl+clicking' it brings up the 'look up google' 'translate' 'copy' and all that type of settings, I didnt know there was another way to do this i always thoguht it was the double click on the trackpad since I havent used a mouse since high school.]
      In this activity, I will be able to apply "a mouse or trackpad shortcuts" for myself in my "current work environment'. Using these skills can help me use them more often and get to learn more about my equipment than I did before. 
      Activity 2: "Tracing Internet Traffic" [HowToGeek: How to use traceroute to identity network problems]
      In this activity, I learned "traceroute is a website server that uses your network". [Traceroute is the process on finding what your searching for and if it dosent load it means that the server is having trouble connecting into your device down the path and this helps/ shows you where it kinda went wrong or what was the problem that cause this and its something new that ive learn becuase i never thought there was somthing like this that was connected to my everyday life. ]
      In this activity, I wil be able to apply "traceroute" for myself in my "current work environment". Becuase now i understand how it works and if theres a website that isnt working i would understand what happen and what i can do to look at it and due to this ill be able to see the problem and demonstrate the internet provided. 
      Session 2B - Internet Fundeamentals/Web Browsers
      Activity 1: "1.Tutorial GCFLearnFree:Chrome" [Practice using web browsers]
      In this activity, I learned "That I needed to download chrome and learn how to bookmark my favorite sites and learn about the different securities chrome has throught a youtube video". 
        [I want to learn how to customize chrome so its the second youtube video that recommends me through the playlist. Looking at the video I first need to open chrome, second I need to 'click' on the 'more botton' on the right corner of the page under the exit, third scroll down to find settings 'click', forth scroll down and 'click' on the title that says 'On startup' after you find it 'click' or 'select' 'open a specific page or set of pages' then 'select' 'add a new page' thats underneath the 'open a specific page or set of pages' 'click' on the 'add a new page' and a 'site URL' will appear later on type 'espn.com' and 'click' 'add' from doing this the browser will take me to a chosen startup page.]
      In this activity, I will be able to apply "better privacy and security" for myself in my "current work environment'. I will be following these steps throught the youtube video and helping my browser to be more secure. '4th video from the same playlist'
      Activity 2: "GCFlearnFree:Internet Tips" [Installing and updating browser plug-ins]
      In this activity, I learned "that it doesnâ€™t matter if your using a cellphone device for this type of problem it only happens when your using some sort of laptop device, these are some problems that happened with these type of devices if they have 'new features' or they are not updated". [What i've learned so far is that check if the device is updated if not these pop ups will appear and some of them arent even the real warning ads so its better to update it through the page and not the advertisement becuase it can later on be fake and someone already has your information and can be bad for yourself.]
      In this activity, I will be able to apply "plug-ins" for myself in my "current work environment'. By downloading the adobe flash player from the page and not an advertisement that popped up and making sure that its always updated and not have the old version. These may come with new features and like it said security fixes like bugs or anything similar. ?
